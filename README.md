# DPT-Renderer: Differentiable Point Renderer
The DPT-renderer, full name as differentiable point renderer, serves the backend of [POINTRIX](). It aims to provide some common underlying operations in differentiable point cloud rendering. Although, only tile based rasterization for 3D Gaussians splatting is supported here, more features will be supported soon.
